## Features

- Extension automatically starts after installation
- Extension contains two commands:
    - Start 7TV Comments
        - This lets you start the extension if it is not already running
    - Stop 7TV Comments
        - This lets you stop the extension if it is currently running
- You can add more images into the images directory inside the vsix file before installing. Use 7-zip to open the vsix file and edit it. (I hate winrar)
